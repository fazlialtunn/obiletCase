## Code Overview

### Architecture

The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, making the code modular, testable, and easier to maintain.

- **Model**: `ProductModel.swift` defines the structure of the data retrieved from the API.
- **ViewModel**: `HomeViewModel` and `DetailViewModel` manages the logic for filtering and searching products.
- **View**: The UI is composed of `HomeViewController`, `DetailViewController`, `HomeTableViewCell`, and `CategoryCollectionViewCell`.

### Networking

- **API Caller**: `APICaller.swift` handles network requests to fetch product data.
- **Service Constants**: `ServiceConstants.swift` defines the base URL for the API.

### UI Components

- **HomeViewController**: Displays the main screen with a search bar, category filters, and a product list.
- **DetailViewController**: Shows detailed information about a selected product.
- **HomeTableViewCell**: A custom table view cell used in the product list.
- **CategoryCollectionViewCell**: A custom collection view cell used for category filtering.

### Unit Tests

The project includes unit tests to ensure the functionality and correctness of various components. Key aspects covered in the unit tests are:

- **ViewModel Tests**: 
  - **HomeViewModel**: Tests validate the correct filtering and searching of products based on user input and category selection. It ensures that the `filteredProducts` array updates accurately based on different filtering criteria.
  - **DetailViewModel**: Tests ensure that the product details are correctly populated and displayed in the `DetailViewController`.

- **Model Tests**: 
  - **ProductModel**: Tests ensure that the `ProductModel` correctly encodes and decodes from JSON, verifying that the modelâ€™s data structure aligns with the API response.

- **Networking Tests**: 
  - **APICaller**: Tests validate that network requests are properly formed and that the data is parsed correctly into `ProductModel` instances. Mock data and responses are used to simulate API calls and ensure that the `fetchData` method behaves as expected.

- **Service Constants Tests**: 
  - Tests ensure that the base URL provided by `ServiceConstants` is correct and used consistently throughout the network layer.
